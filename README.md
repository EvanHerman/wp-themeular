# WP Themeular

Custom Angular.js powered WordPress theme

I became interested in learning more about Angular.js, so I figured I'd build up a custom theme. 


##### to do:
* Setup Grunt.js to take care of automation tasks
* Download latest release of each .js/.css file and serve them locally
* Setup custom menu management and power it via Angular.js
* Prepare for WP REST API  v2
